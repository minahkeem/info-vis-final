# Information Visualization Final Project (D3)
This is my final project for the Information Visualization course at NYU Tandon SOE.
I have designed and implemented a visualization based on a Yelp dataset, which consists of information about reviews collected in Yelp (type of restaurant, average rating, and number of reviews).
The visualization serves to answer the following questions:
  1. Are there restaurants that have consistently positive/negative (above/below average) reviews?
  2. Are there restaurants that for which in some time periods their rating drops/increases considerably?
  3. How many restaurants are in each category?
  4. How are the ratings distributed in each category over time? Are there categories in which restaurants tend to have more positive/negative ratings?
  5. [Extra] How reliable is the average rating measure at any given time for a given restaurant? That is, according to how many reviews is the average value calculated?
